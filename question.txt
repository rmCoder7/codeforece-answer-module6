problem 2
========

Given N numbers. Count how many of these values are even, odd, positive and negative.

Input
First line contains one number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 103) number of values.

Second line contains N numbers (-105 ≤ Xi ≤ 105).

Output
Print four lines with the following format:

First Line: "Even: X", where X is the number of even numbers in the given input.

Second Line: "Odd: X", where X is the number of odd numbers in the given input.

Third Line: "Positive: X", where X is the number of positive numbers in the given input.

Fourth Line: "Negative: X", where X is the number of negative numbers in the given input.

problem:4
==========

Given multiple lines each line contains a number X which is a password. Print "Wrong" if the password is incorrect otherwise, print "Correct" and terminate the program.

Note: The "Correct" password is the number 1999.

Input
The input contains several passwords.

Each line contains a number X (103 ≤ X ≤ 104 - 1).

Output
Print "Wrong" if the password is typed wrong otherwise, print "Correct" if the password is typed correctly.

Example
inputCopy
2200
1020
1999
1000
9999
outputCopy
Wrong
Wrong
Correct

Output
Print the maximum number.

Example
inputCopy
5
1 8 5 7 5
outputCopy
